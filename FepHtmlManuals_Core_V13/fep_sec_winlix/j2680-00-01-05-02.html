Refer to "Protecting Storage Data Using Transparent Data Encryption" in the Operation Guide for details.</p><p>Additionally, if communication data transferred between a client and a server contains confidential information, it is necessary to encrypt the communication data to protect it against threats, such as eavesdropping on the network.</p><p>Refer to "Configuring Secure Communication Using Secure Sockets Layer" in the Operation Guide for details on encryption of communication data.</p></div><p class="subhead_1" id="IDchap01N11"><span class="em">Audit log</span></p><div class="textblock"><p>A feature that addresses threats such as misuse of administrator privileges, unauthorized access to a database by a user, and other such threats. Information for tracing the processing of administrators and users is retrieved and stored as an audit log.</p><p>By periodically viewing and monitoring audit logs, the administrators can detect events that are impacting on the system in some way, or are depleting system resources as a result of incorrect operations by users, and can take appropriate measures to prevent information leakages or system failures in advance.</p><p>Refer to "<a href="j2680-00-06-00-00.html">Chapter&nbsp;6 Audit Log Feature</a>" for details.</p></div><p class="subhead_1" id="IDchap01N12"><span class="em">Data masking</span></p><div class="textblock"><p>A feature that changes part of the data to make it available for reference in response to queries issued by an application.</p><p>For example, for a query of employee data, digits except the last four digits of an eight-digit employee number can be changed to "*" so that it can be used for reference without exposing the actual data.</p><p>Specifically, the data changed by the data masking feature can be transferred to a test database so that users who perform testing or development can reference the data. During testing, it is desirable to use the data that will be used on a production environment database. However, actual production data should not be used as is for testing because of the risk of leakage of confidential data. This feature enables data that is similar to actual production data to be safely used in test and development environments.</p><p>Refer to "Data Masking" in the Operation Guide for details on data masking.</p></div></div><div class="header_footer"><div class="back_next"><a href="j2680-00-01-05-01.html"><img src="image/back2.gif" width="65" height="27" border="0" alt="Previous" title="Previous"></a><a href="j2680-00-02-00-00.html"><img src="image/next2.gif" width="64" height="27" border="0" alt="Next" title="Next"></a></div><div class="copyright">Copyright 2018-2021 FUJITSU LIMITED </div></div></body></html>
